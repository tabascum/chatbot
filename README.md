# chatbot

I've done this project accoding to Hyperskill / Jetbrains Frontend Development course.
It allowed me to cover all the basic principles in JS, as well as practicing how to aplly those concepts.
This small chatbot allowed me to pratice how to declare and assign variables, how do functions work and can be called and how to get input() from website's users.
